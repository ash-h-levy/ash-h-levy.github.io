# Superstore Customer Cohort Analysis using a Tableau Accelerator

This project utilized the Superstore Sales sample dataset and a Tableau Accelerator from Bizstory. 

Tableau Acceleratorsare a collection of pre-built dashboards that are designed to help businesses address specific data visualization needs. These dashboards are created by Tableau experts and are tailored to meet the unique requirements of different industries and use cases. The dashboards offered by Bizstory, for example, are designed to cater to the needs of businesses in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and retail, among others.The use of a Tableau Accelerator in this project reduced the time and effort required to create a custom dashboard, as many of the steps required to build a dashboard had already been completed. This allows for the focus to be on analyzing and interpreting the data, rather than spending time on the mechanics of dashboard creation. 

The Superstore Dataset is a synthetic dataset that is widely used in Tableau and contains data related to sales, profit, and various other metrics for a fictitious office supply store. This dataset is often used for training and learning purposes in Tableau due to its comprehensiveness and ease of use.

This project analyzes the sales and customer data for a fictitious office supply store to answer key questions, such as customer acquisition and retention, segment performance, and potential growth opportunities.



## 1. Gathering the Data

The data was obtained from [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/resources/sample-data) and downloaded for use in the project. To prepare the data for use with the selected accelerator, it was imported into Google Sheets to be formatted the next steps.

## 2. Selecting the Appropriate Accelerator

The Tableau Exchange offers a range of accelerators that provide pre-built dashboards for various business needs. For this project, the focus was on analyzing customer data from a retail store, so accelerators in the Retail section were explored. The [BizStory Customer Cohort Accelerator](https://exchange.tableau.com/products/830) was selected as it was well-suited to answering questions about customer acquisition and retention, which were key areas of interest for the project. Furthermore, the Superstore dataset contained all the necessary fields required for analysis using this accelerator.

## 3. Cleaning and Preparing the Data

Based on the instructions provided with the accelerator, a table with six specific fields needed to be created. To fulfill this requirement, a new sheet was created in Google Sheets. The necessary fields were populated with data using formulas that referenced data from other sheets within the same workbook. The segment field was used instead of the sub-category field as it provided more relevant and useful insights for the analysis. This approach ensured that any changes made to the original data were automatically reflected in the newly created table.
