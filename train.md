## Train Derailment Dashbard Using Tableau

Following the derailment that occurred in East Palestine, Ohio on February 3, 2023, there has been a notable surge in news coverage regarding train derailments. This has prompted me to ask the question: **Has there been an actual increase in train derailments or is the media simply more inclined to report on them due to the recent catastrophe in East Palestine?**



### 1. Finding Data
The Federal Railroad Administration curates a comprehensive database of rail equipment incidents and accidents, which is sourced from the Form 54 submissions. The Form 54 is a federal report that rail companies submit to report any incidents or accidents. As of March 2023, the database encompasses information spanning from 1975 to 2022.

### 2. Planning the Dashboard 
In the initial mockups that I designed, my intention was to utilize both a map and stacked line chart to effectively present the data. However, upon creating the stacked line chart, I noticed that certain data points were unclear due to scaling issues. Consequently, I realized the need to explore alternative visualizations that could better represent the data and convey its intended message with clarity.


### 3. Final Dashboard


<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1681934006336' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 3 (2) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;De&#47;DerailmentData&#47;Dashboard32&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='DerailmentData&#47;Dashboard32' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;De&#47;DerailmentData&#47;Dashboard32&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>  

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
